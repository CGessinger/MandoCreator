				<h1>Changelog</h1>
				<h2>Version 3.3</h2>
				<p>This update consists of mostly back-end changes. Nonetheless, it has some new features, like Undo for armor parts, as live previews of helmets and chest plates.</p>
				<p>We now also store your settings across sessions, so the days of accidentally reloading and having to start over are no more.</p>
				<h2>Version 3.2</h2>
				<p>The best partnerships are those that last. In that spirit, AlterEgoArmory has increased their offer by four more Helmets. Enjoy their Rook, Vanguard, Foreman and Mountaineer!</p>
				<h2>Version 3.1</h2>
				<p>Once again we add a new partner to the site. Everybody, give a warm <i>Oya!</i> to Mynock's Den, who brings four of their helmets to the site: The Recon, the Operator, the GI as well Shae Vizla.</p>
				<p>We also added the ability to use a wider variety of image formats as backgrounds in the SVG download. You can now use animated GIFs, among others.</p>
				<h2>Version 3.0</h2>
				<p>After a long wait, this update brings several new features, making the website better than ever before.</p>
				<p>Check out the Gallery to browse through user-submitted designs looking for inspiration, and use the Creator to customize them further.</p>
				<p>We originally decided to download creations as SVG, so that users have the greatest amount of customization available to them after the fact. However, since SVGs aren't supported in all places, we added a JPEG download to the site. Now you can choose. Not that if you want to re-upload a creation, you have to use the SVG.</p>
				<p>We also added four new helmets - Ursa Wren and The Grunt by Lonewolf Customs, the Ramikadyc and the Neo Crusader. Furthermore, the Classic Helmet has been upgraded with the new Visors. These are the winners of our VisorCreator contest. Thank you for all your submissions!</p>
				<p>Lastly, we added the ability to undo and redo color changes. This functionality is highly experimental, and therefore slight problems are to be expected. If oyu encounter any such problems, please report them to us on our Discord Server. Thank you</p>
				<h2>Version 2.4</h2>
				<p>We have reached the third and last step in our series of major armor updates: Lower Armor. Your legs will look fancier than ever before. You now have new options for Shins, Knees, Thighs, Holsters, Capes, Ankles and Toes.</p>
				<h2>Version 2.3</h2>
				<p>Happy New Year, and happy new Buckets! To start the new year off right, we bring you a pair of new helmets.</p>
				<p>First of all, we would like to welcome our new Partner, Gedyc Armouries , who reached out to us to bring his amazing Ironside helmet to the site. Thank you, vod, your support means a lot to us, and welcome to the Partner Club!</p>
				<p>The second new bucket is long overdue. Not strictly Mando, but definitely good-looking, is the Republic Commando Helmet!</p>
				<h2>Version 2.2</h2>
				<p>This update continues the trend that we started with Version 2.0. Working our way down along the armor, it is only logical that today we bring you a variety of customization options for the Upper Body. This includes Chest Plates, but also various Gauntlets, Shoulder Plates and a few capes - and more.</p>
				<h2>Version 2.1</h2>
				<p>We have our third partner! Lonewolf Customs joined the crew with their stunning Executioner Helmet design.</p>
				<p>Let me remind you, that our Partners get to decide, which customization options are available for their helmets, and so the Executioner only allows a Range Finder on the right side for now.</p>
				<h2>Version 2.0</h2>
				<p>Finally. Today's update is the largest one so far, and it comes with some big changes. In the four week lifetime of the site we have gotten many suggestions for more buckets to add.
With the Gunslinger and Heavy we started down this path, and today we climb the first summit, adding eleven new helmets to the collection for a total of eighteen.</p>
				<p>With this update, we are also happy to announce the first partners of the site. We teamed up with Ryley Ameden from AlterEgoArmory, as well as the vode from ModernMando, to bring their awesome designs to a MandoCreator near you.</p>
				<p>A huge "Vor entye" for their support! We are truly grateful.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, any item that has a left and right variant can now be mirorred, replicating all settings on the other side.</p>
				<p>Lastly, You are no longer restricted to one Earcap Attachment. You can now select multiple options from a list of icon-previes.</p>
				<h2>Version 1.4</h2>
				<p>This Update comes with big changes in the way we store colors. The times of accidentally changing a piece, and loosing all progress are gone!</p>
				<p>Accidentally switched from male to female? No problem, all your settings carry over exactly as they are.</p>
				<p>Accidentally changed to a different Chest piece? No problem, switch back and your colors are still there.</p>
				<p>This allows you to test out, what your female design would look like on a man, and vice versa.</p>
				<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
				<p>Be it Gunslinger or Heavy Infantry, use the Din Djarin and Paz Vizsla Chest Pieces to make your dreams come true.</p>
				<p>This update also includes the new options for Holsters, Shin Wraps, belts, Neck Seals and Fingerless Gloves.</p>
				<h2>Version 1.2</h2>
				<p>You can now download your creations, share them with your friends, and then re-upload them to continue editing.</p>
				<p>Note that this does not work with Screenshots, or any format besides the one directly downloaded from the site.</p>
				<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
				<p>Add Trauma-Plating to the Lower Armor. They won't be kicking your shins now!</p>
				<h2>Version 1.0</h2>
				<p>This is the first Release. K'emuuri!</p>
